# Finding-The-Best-Markets-To-Advertise-In

## Please open on nbviewer to ensure that charts are plotted

By some reason, Github does not plot charts created on altair, even though they run normally in jupyter notebook. Therefore I highly suggest accessing this [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/celioxf/Finding-The-Best-Markets-To-Advertise-In/tree/master/) to read the analysis.

# Project's Goal
Many companies looking to increase revenues have to optimize their investiments in advertisement. That's the idea behind this project. I cleaned and analysed data from a survey conducted by freeCodeCamp and found out where the most visitors of the platform are located as well as how much they spend on learning every month. Finally, I created an interactive map that summarises all this information.
